 * EasyHook crashing targets, RhInjectLibrary on Win7 64bit, 32bit process, 32bit injection dll + launcher application = problem - now determines the address of GetProcAddress etc by reading the remote process' PE image
 * Easyhook was not unloaded when host is closed, Allow RemoteHook unloading - managed EasyHook.dll and user assemblies are now loaded into a new AppDomain which is then unloaded when the custom IEntryPoint Run method returns. A new assembly - EasyLoad32/64.dll - that makes use of managed DllExport's provides a more stable .NET framework initialisation.
 * FileMon example updated to no longer require the GAC
