 * Hooking of CreateFile fails on Win 8.1 x64, Compatiblity With Windows Server 2012 And 8, Crashed Notepad in Win 8 64-bit, 2.7 FileMon crashes 64-bit processes, Do not work on Windows8 x64., relative mov in EntryPoint not handled - correctly relocates RIP addresses (64-bit). Windows 8/8.1 kernel32 APIs now all use RIP addressing when passing through to kernelbase.
 * Command-line arguments problem in RtlCreateSuspendedProcess - command line correctly passed through
 * Bug in RtlGetLastErrorString, RtlGetLastErrorString() returns empty string for invalidate parameter - fixed marshalling bug with RtlGetLastErrorString across managed boundary
 * Severe bug: `LhWaitForPendingRemovals` hangs forever - LhWaitForPendingRemovals endless loop under certain circumstance
 * Compiling 2.7 on VS 2012 fails with some issues - support for VS2012
 * Host process crashes when unloading hooks - fixed crashes when unloading 64-bit hooks. This also fixes the crash within the ProcessMonitor sample.
