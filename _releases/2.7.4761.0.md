 * .Net 4.0 / Visual Studio 2010 - Implemented support for injection without using GAC registration or administrator privileges and added support for .NET 4.0 GAC interaction using managed GAC wrapper for InstallAssemblies/UninstallAssemblies
 * Eliminate GAC usage requirement - registration in the GAC is no longer a requirement to support injection
 * Memory leaks - fixed minor memory leak
 * Some programs hang during exit when hooked/EasyHook freezes terminating application - fixed target freezing when closing
 * Relocating entry point - added support for short unconditional jumps
 * Implement `LhGetInstructionLength` stub - implemented a new instruction length decoder (supports larger opcode set)
 * No GAC - passing complex object as inject parameter - support passing complex objects as parameters to EasyHook.IEntryPoint (even if not using GAC)
 * Support method overload in IEntryPoint - allows more flexibility when implementing EasyHook.IEntryPoint classes
 * Added build configurations for .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 allowing targeted builds for either framework version.
 * Added MSBuild script to build all configurations and prepare release packages
 * Build output path has been changed to `".\Build\Configuration\Platform\"`. E.g. `".\Build\netfx4-Debug\x64\"`
